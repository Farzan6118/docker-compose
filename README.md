# ‚öôÔ∏è Docker Compose Collection

## üìñ Overview

This project provides a curated collection of Docker Compose setups for many popular technologies used by developers.  
Each technology is organized into its own folder, containing a `docker-compose.yml` file and optional `.env` configuration, making it easy to run and test services locally.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/.../docker-compose.git
   cd docker-compose
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired folder**:  
   Each folder contains a `docker-compose.yml` file and a corresponding `.env` file (if needed). Choose the folder for the technology you want to use.

3. **Run Docker Compose**:

   docker compose up
   ```
   This command will start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the selected service.
